# mth511
Course Project

The code file containing the functions in order to reproduce the results of our report can be found here (mth511_final.py)

The last cell of the notebook would enable to fix a distribution (Normal/Gamma) and method (EL,AEL,TEL,TAEL,NA) and then iterate over all possible combinations of pi0 pi1 and sample size n

The functions are defined clearly through comments in the notebook.
